## What this project is about

This is a travel app, where a user can read about a destination, vieuw images of the destination and read reviews and ratings. It was my frist time using react native so this was a bit of a introduction project for me. Most of the styling is inline styling with some libraries, please checkout: **[Goals for this project](#goals-for-this-project)**
